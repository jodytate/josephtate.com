      <h3>Heron</h3>

      <p>While driving in, the sun rakes harsh and cold<br>
      across the yawning median, its surge</p>

      <p>of unmowed grasses tall and gone to seed.<br>
      At seven thirty two, you park and watch</p>

      <p>the business park retention basin fleck<br>
      the building's anchored masonry veneer—</p>

      <p>its tilt-up spandrels bright as dry begasse,<br>
      abrasive-blasted precast concrete curtain walls</p>

      <p>glass-fiber reinforced for tensile strength<br>
      —and tinted panes of not-quite mirrored glass</p>

      <p>with noiseless, sharp undulatory light.<br>
      Still in the car, the windows down, you hear</p>

      <p>the smoothing of an absent heron's wings,<br>
      the culverted and unnamed creeks;</p>

      <p>Nothing is overgrown except behind<br>
      the split-rail fence and even measured ditch.</p>

      <p>(The site-selection team concluded that—<br>
      few wetland fauna photographed,</p>

      <p>the extant trails unplanned desire lines<br>
      —a horizontal build atop the creeks</p>

      <p>cost less considering indemnity,<br>
      the zoning laws, land-use controls.)</p>

      <p>Inside, they're unresponsive to, at first,<br>
      a contract worker, your retractable</p>

      <p>ID: the color-coded keycard badge<br>
      on lanyards fiddled with like rosaries. </p>

      <p>Not introduced, yet hers or his a face<br>
      or voice you recognize from storage rooms</p>

      <p>of copy paper, weak black ballpoint pens,<br>
      inkjet and laser printer cartridges. </p>

      <p>Within a week or so, they chat as if<br>
      you started yesterday about the vague</p>

      <p>admonishment to clean the microwave:<br>
      a printed out and taped up clip-art sign.</p>

      <p>You nod, grind teeth and wonder if they see<br>
      you're thinking of the parking lot, its tar</p>

      <p>emulsion sealant; oil-based zone line paint;<br>
      the slipform curbs seem all a fire-lane red;</p>

      <p>a heron tilts its head, the culvert's mouth<br>
      begins to gather mud in careful folds.</p>
