      <h3>Excerpt from "Leave"</h3>

      <p>She IM'd him to have a one-on-one<br>
      discussion of the sort that runs one way.<br>
      "I'll meet you in Crayon in five."</p>

      <p>The building's smaller conference rooms<br>
      ("larger" here means 12 x 12 or more)<br>
      seldom have conferences, whatever that<br>
      word might mean—he'd never seen one happen.<br>
      Mt Porte Crayon Meeting Room, its full name,<br>
      (the room names match the P1000 peaks<br>
      in West Virginia, 44 in all)<br>
      is nearest to the elevator hall<br>
      and has more privacy despite the glass <br>
      door and triple-paned windows. The view<br>
      is dense with bushes, oval waxy leaves,<br>
      and a sloping parking lot (its striping paint<br>
      bright and clean in the slow autumn, clumsy sun).<br> 
      The room's east/west left/right untextured walls <br>
      are two shades less than avocado green.<br>
      The vinyl chairs complement with a thin, <br>
      dull algae hue. The two opposing high <br>
      thin walls, without pretense, are sand dune white.</p>

      <p>Early per usual he sat and traced<br>
      the heat-shimmer edged shadows slanting<br>
      across the table—slight burled birch-veneered<br> 
      —and dulled through the clanging, thin metal blinds<br>
      The Polycom unplugged and dusty, smelled<br> 
      of fresh Saltines.</p>

      <p>She entered harried, tight:<br>
      a magnet coiled with "Sorry! :)" pleasantries<br>
      (her office on this floor and one row down).<br>
      If middle management, you place your iPhone<br>
      near where your wrists will rest while talking slow.<br>
      The managers are taught a dialect<br>
      that has a sour-sounding lilt. It's meant<br>
      to sooth the employee. You also learn<br>
      to posture-check yourself ("for some, your back<br>
      might hurt at first") and "I-to-eye" contact.<p>

      <p>He rubbed his bitten fingernails (one bled<br>
      a bit this morning on the way to work).<br>
      After the half-expected work-life bal-<br>
      ance talk, or rather "talking-to", she made<br>
      her point: he had to use his PTO.<br>
      This year, he would. She checked her notepad (yes,<br>
      despite what century we're living in<br>
      she takes her meeting notes in longhand, tall<br>
      wide letters she circles and underlines)<br>
      and found the page: I'm glad to hear it. Laurence. Yes—<br>
      (Law- or Laurence, pronounced the same but spelled<br>
      however the barista feels that day;<br>
      he gave up spelling out the name last year.)<br>
      the month of April rarely gets approved.<br>
      The IRM's the same as US Code<br>
      so in this case tradition matters most.<br>  
      August? May, September can be nice.<br>
      The Sharepoint site would have the forms<br>
      and someone had the room booked after them.<p>

      <p>He shifted, looked outside. A heavy lull<br>
      began to fill the room. She hemmed again.<br>
      She'd check the lifecycle (their certified<br>
      approach to IT service management,<br>
      called ITIL version 3, or "eye-till three")<br>
      was current, practical and common sense.<br>
      The data service RESTful API<br>
      was documented well and April c/sh-ould be fine.<br> 
      About one week, including the 15th.<br>
      You'll need to take a laptop, check your mail,<br>
      be—business hours—available by phone.<br>
      So what're your (grabbing iPhone) plans?<p>

      <p>Expedia and Travelocity<br>
      had zero flights from HGR to DBQ.<br>
      (On Travelocity that search returned<br>
      a message worded: "problem processing,"<br>
      etc. The debug console showed<br>
      a client-side request timeout and fail.<br>
      More googling, he found a route that worked<br>
      (the airport codes return the best results).<br>
      From IAD to MLI, with one<br>
      connecting stop at DTW.<br>
      The cheapest Delta flight from Apr 10<br>
      to 17. Reserved the rental car<br>
      with upgrade (special season package deal).<br>
      Four-door Corolla. Manual windows. White.<br>
      Few names of cars seem well thought out.<br>
      Corolla: petals of a flower form <br>
      a whorl within the sepals and enclose<br>
      the reproductive organs. Focusing,<br>
      he checked the inkjet, pulled up Google maps:<br>
      Maquoketa, the caves where Norris Brown<br>
      had felt the weight of equal stones.</p>
