    <h3>Punctuation</h3>
      <p>
        <small>“... when a thought takes one’s breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence.”<br>
            —Thomas Wentworth Higginson</small>
      </p>

    <p>1.</p>

    <p>the Ten-Foot Poet culled the latest sea-slopped syllables<br>
    with a calm and marble Harrumph.<br>
    “... too little or too much punctuation and similar aberrations.</p>

    <p>These have nothing to do with being alive.” (nor dying.<br>
    such pronouncements: that’s how you unmake friends.<br>
    “He looks down on everybody,” Frost said.)</p>


    <p>2.</p>
    <p>
      the Tyrian Poet projected from the dock:<br>
      “who / can tell another how / to manage the swimming?”<br>
      (he told Creeley who didn’t mind his management)
    </p>

    <p>poem as energy. space & punctuation<br>
    as breath. a typebar’s dull kniving to exact the greengreyseasway<br>
    or: a typewheel turn toward the necessary pause.</p>


    <p>3.</p>

    <p>they “left me boundaries of pain / Capacious as the sea.”<br>
    and widening water: silent, stilled; clouding.<br>
    I fumble-paddle shorewise with disappointed lungs.</p>
