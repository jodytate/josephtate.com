    <h3>By a Stream in the Upper Part of So. Carolina</h3>

    <p>The feel that flowing water sifts across<br>
    The toes or down a throat is good, though cold.<br>
    We bend to see a face retold with loss<br>
    On golden waves and there, the stones below:<br>
    All smoothed by years, not wrinkled like our skin.<br>
    A stone refuses death. The water spun<br>
    From mountain tops, the mud formed in the spin,<br>
    Are old. But we, with souls alive and young<br>
    Are lulled to dreams by this slow, murmured song.<br>
    A lullaby that rocks a soul in deep<br>
    Embrace. These stones could not resist for long<br>
    For rushing water rushes all to sleep.<br>
    The stream reveals in time with whom we flirt,<br>
    Then, grain on grain the stone becomes the dirt.</p>
